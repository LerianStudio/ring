# TRD Creation - Architecture Before Implementation

## Foundational Principle

**Architecture decisions (HOW/WHERE) must be technology-agnostic patterns before concrete implementation choices.**

Specifying technologies in TRD creates:
- Vendor lock-in before evaluating alternatives
- Architecture coupled to specific products
- Inability to adapt to better options discovered later
- Technology decisions made without full dependency analysis

**The TRD answers**: HOW we'll architect the solution and WHERE components will live.
**The TRD never answers**: WHAT specific products, frameworks, versions, or packages we'll use.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- PRD has passed Gate 1 validation (REQUIRED)
- Feature Map has passed Gate 2 validation (optional - use if exists)
- About to design technical architecture
- Tempted to specify "PostgreSQL" instead of "Relational Database"
- Asked to create technical design or architecture document
- Before making technology choices

## Mandatory Workflow

### Phase 1: Technical Analysis (Inputs Required)
1. **Approved PRD** (Gate 1 passed) - business requirements locked (REQUIRED)
2. **Approved Feature Map** (Gate 2 passed) - feature relationships mapped (OPTIONAL - check `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/feature-map.md`)
3. **Identify non-functional requirements** (performance, security, scalability)
4. **Map domains to components**:
   - If Feature Map exists: Map Feature Map domains to architectural components
   - If no Feature Map: Map PRD features directly to architectural components

### Phase 2: Architecture Definition
1. **Choose Architecture Style** (Microservices, Modular Monolith, Serverless)
2. **Design Components** with clear boundaries and responsibilities
3. **Define Interfaces** (inbound/outbound, contracts)
4. **Model Data Architecture** (ownership, flows, relationships)
5. **Plan Integration Patterns** (sync/async, protocols)
6. **Design Security Architecture** (layers, threat model)

### Phase 3: Gate 3 Validation
**MANDATORY CHECKPOINT** - Must pass before proceeding:
- [ ] All Feature Map domains mapped to components (if Feature Map exists)
- [ ] All PRD features mapped to components (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Component boundaries are clear and logical
- [ ] Interfaces are well-defined and technology-agnostic
- [ ] Data ownership is explicit
- [ ] Quality attributes are achievable
- [ ] Integration patterns are selected
- [ ] No specific technology products named

## Explicit Rules

### ✅ DO Include in TRD
- System architecture style (pattern names, not products)
- Component design with responsibilities
- Data architecture (ownership, flows, models - conceptual)
- API design (contracts, not specific protocols)
- Security architecture (layers, threat model)
- Integration patterns (sync/async, not specific tools)
- Performance targets and scalability strategy
- Deployment topology (logical, not specific cloud services)

### ❌ NEVER Include in TRD
- Specific technology products (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Framework versions (Fiber v2, React 18, Express 5)
- Programming language specifics (Go 1.24, Node.js 20)
- Cloud provider services (AWS RDS, Azure Functions, GCP Pub/Sub)
- Package/library names (bcrypt, zod, sqlc, prisma)
- Container orchestration specifics (Kubernetes, ECS, Lambda)
- CI/CD pipeline details
- Infrastructure-as-code specifics (Terraform, CloudFormation)

### Technology Abstraction Rules
1. **Database**: Say "Relational Database" not "PostgreSQL 16"
2. **Cache**: Say "In-Memory Cache" not "Redis" or "Valkey"
3. **Message Queue**: Say "Message Broker" not "RabbitMQ"
4. **Object Storage**: Say "Blob Storage" not "MinIO" or "S3"
5. **Web Framework**: Say "HTTP Router" not "Fiber" or "Express"
6. **Auth**: Say "JWT-based Authentication" not "specific library"

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Everyone knows we use PostgreSQL" | Assumptions prevent proper evaluation. Stay abstract. |
| "Just mentioning the tech stack for context" | Context belongs in Dependency Map. Keep TRD abstract. |
| "The team needs to know what we're using" | They'll know in Dependency Map. TRD is patterns only. |
| "It's obvious we need Redis here" | Obvious ≠ documented. Abstract to "cache", decide later. |
| "I'll save time by specifying frameworks now" | You'll waste time when better options emerge. Wait. |
| "But our project template requires X" | Templates are implementation. TRD is architecture. Separate. |
| "The dependency is critical to the design" | Then describe the *capability* needed, not the product. |
| "Stakeholders expect to see technology choices" | Stakeholders see them in Dependency Map. Not here. |
| "Architecture decisions depend on technology X" | Then your architecture is too coupled. Redesign abstractly. |
| "We already decided on the tech stack" | Decisions without analysis are assumptions. Validate later. |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself writing any of these in a TRD, **STOP**:

- Specific product names with version numbers
- Package manager commands (npm install, go get, pip install)
- Cloud provider service names (RDS, Lambda, Cloud Run, etc.)
- Framework-specific terms (Fiber middleware, React hooks, Express routers)
- Container/orchestration specifics (Docker, K8s, ECS)
- Programming language version constraints
- Infrastructure service names (CloudFront, Cloudflare, Fastly)
- CI/CD tool names (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins)

**When you catch yourself**: Replace the product name with the capability it provides. "PostgreSQL 16" → "Relational Database with ACID guarantees"

## API Pattern Decisions

During TRD creation, certain architectural patterns require explicit decisions. These decisions should be made during the TRD phase, not deferred to implementation.

### Pagination Strategy (REQUIRED for List Endpoints)

If the feature includes **list/browse** functionality, you **MUST** decide the pagination strategy during TRD.

**Decision Prompt for User:**

```
The feature includes list endpoints. I need to determine the pagination strategy.

Based on the entity characteristics, I recommend [RECOMMENDED OPTION].

Which pagination strategy should be used?

A) Cursor-Based Pagination
   - Best for: High-volume data (>10k records), infinite scroll, real-time feeds
   - Trade-off: Cannot jump to arbitrary pages
   - Performance: O(1) - constant time regardless of dataset size

B) Page-Based (Offset) Pagination
   - Best for: Low-volume data, administrative interfaces
   - Trade-off: Performance degrades with large offsets
   - Performance: O(n) - slower as page number increases

C) Page-Based with Total Count
   - Best for: When UI needs "Page X of Y" display
   - Trade-off: Additional COUNT query overhead
   - Performance: Two queries per request

D) No Pagination
   - Best for: Very small, bounded datasets (<100 items always)
   - Trade-off: All data loaded at once

E) Other - Please describe your requirements
   - Use this if you have specific pagination needs not covered above
```

**Decision Criteria:**

| Factor | Cursor-Based | Page-Based |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Dataset size | >10k records typical | <10k records typical |
| Real-time data | Yes - data changes frequently | No - data is stable |
| Jump to page | Not required | Required |
| Performance | Critical | Not critical |
| UI pattern | Infinite scroll, "Load more" | Traditional page numbers |

**Document the Decision:**

In the TRD, include the pagination decision in the API design section:

```yaml
API Patterns:
  Pagination:
    Strategy: Cursor-Based  # or Page-Based, Page-Based with Total, None
    Rationale: High-volume entity with real-time updates
    Reference: See project standards for implementation details
```

**Implementation Reference:**

After TRD approval, developers should reference:
1. `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` (local project) - project-specific standards
2. Ring Standards via WebFetch - base technical patterns (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang.md` for Go)

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

When making major decisions, document them abstractly:

```markdown
**ADR-001: Hexagonal Architecture Pattern**
- **Context**: Need clear separation between business logic and external dependencies
- **Options Considered**:
  - Layered Architecture: Simple but couples layers
  - Hexagonal: Clear boundaries, testable, flexible
  - Event-Driven: Eventual consistency complexity
- **Decision**: Hexagonal Architecture
- **Rationale**:
  - Business logic independent of frameworks
  - Easy to swap adapters (database, HTTP, etc.)
  - Testable without external dependencies
- **Consequences**:
  - More initial structure needed
  - Team needs to understand ports/adapters
  - Clear boundaries prevent technical debt
```

**Note**: Still no technology products mentioned. Pattern names only.

## Confidence Scoring

```yaml
Component: "[Architecture Element]"
Confidence Factors:
  Pattern Match: [0-40]
    - Exact pattern used before: 40
    - Similar pattern adapted: 25
    - Novel but researched: 10

  Complexity Management: [0-30]
    - Simple, proven approach: 30
    - Moderate complexity: 20
    - High complexity: 10

  Risk Level: [0-30]
    - Low risk, proven path: 30
    - Moderate risk, mitigated: 20
    - High risk, accepted: 10

Total: [0-100]

Action:
  80+: Present architecture autonomously
  50-79: Present multiple options
  <50: Request clarification on requirements
```

## Output Location

**Always output to**: `docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/trd.md`

## After TRD Approval

1. ✅ Lock the TRD - architecture patterns are now reference
2. 🎯 Use TRD as input for API/Contract Design (next phase: `pre-dev-api-design`)
3. 🚫 Never add specific technologies to TRD retroactively
4. 📋 Keep architecture/implementation strictly separated

## Quality Self-Check

Before declaring TRD complete, verify:
- [ ] All Feature Map domains have architectural representation
- [ ] All PRD requirements have architectural solution
- [ ] Zero product names or versions present
- [ ] All capabilities described abstractly
- [ ] Component boundaries follow DDD principles
- [ ] Interfaces are technology-agnostic
- [ ] Data ownership is explicit and documented
- [ ] Security is designed into architecture (not bolted on)
- [ ] Performance targets are set and achievable
- [ ] Scalability path is clear and logical
- [ ] Gate 3 validation checklist 100% complete

## The Bottom Line

**If you wrote a TRD with specific technology products, delete those sections and rewrite abstractly.**

The TRD is architecture patterns only. Period. No product names. No versions. No frameworks.

Technology choices go in Dependency Map. That's the next phase. Wait for it.

Violating this separation means:
- You're committing to technologies before evaluating alternatives
- Architecture becomes coupled to specific vendors
- You can't objectively compare technology options later
- Costs, licensing, and compatibility aren't analyzed
- Team loses flexibility to adapt

**Stay abstract. Stay flexible. Make technology decisions in the next phase with full analysis.**
